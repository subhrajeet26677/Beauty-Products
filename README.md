In the above video I have 1st created a web site using HTML, CSS, bootsrap, javascript, JS. Like i have made index.html, contact.html for the contact information and much more for the better experience for the customers, Then I publish it on my git hub account by using statements like "git init", "git push" and "git commit -m "The project is committed" " and then it have taken some time to be deployed like about 2 to 3 min. Then I have gone to Microsoft azure portal and then I have mainly used static web app for the deployment for my website. Then after going into static web app. I have clicked create web app and i have given my resource group, application name and then clicked review+create option and then clicked create option for the deployment for the website. Then we will again go to out gitHub id and then go into that repo and then go to the action statement, there it will be showing the website is deploying and then after 5 min, our website will be deployed. For the checking, we will again go to our azure site and click the project usl, we will see that our site is deployed using Microsoft azure. Thank You
